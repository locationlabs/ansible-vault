# ansible-vault lookup module
This is a lookup module for secrets stored in [HashiCorp Vault](https://vaultproject.io/).
Supports Ansible 1.9.x and 2.x

### Installation
lookup plugins can be loaded from several different locations similar to `$PATH`, see
[lookup_plugins](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_configuration.html#lookup-plugins).

The source for the plugin can be pointed to via a _requirements.yml_ file, and
accessed via [`ansible-galaxy`](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/galaxy.html).

### Configuration
The address to the Vault server and the auth token are fetched from
environment variables.

    export VAULT_ADDR=http://192.168.33.10:8200/
    export VAULT_TOKEN=56f48aef-8ad3-a0c4-447b-8e96990776ff

The plugin also supports Vault's CA-related environment variables, to
enable use of a server certificate issued by a not-widely-trusted
Certificate Authority. Use of this feature in the plugin requires
Python 2.7.9.

    export VAULT_CACERT=/etc/ssl/certs/localCA.pem
    export VAULT_CAPATH=/etc/ssl/localCA

The Vault address, CA certificate, and path can also be set via the Ansible
variables `vault_addr`, `vault_cacert`, and `vault_capath`, respectively. For
more information on setting variables in Ansible, see the
[variables docs](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_variables.html).

The Vault token intentionally can **not** be set via an Ansible variable, as
this is generally checked into revision control and would be a bad security
practice somewhat defeating the purpose of using Vault. The token can be read
from the file `$HOME/.vault-token`, as documented at
[Vault environment variables](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/commands/environment.html).

If any such parameter is set by both an environment variable and an
alternative means, the environment variable takes precedence.

### Usage
ansible-vault works as any other lookup plugin.

```yaml
- debug: msg="{{ lookup('vault', 'secret/foo', 'value') }}"
```

```yaml
# templates/example.j2

# Generic secrets
{{ lookup('vault', 'secret/hello').value }} # world
# Generic secrets with parameters
{{ lookup('vault', 'pki/issue/example-dot-com common_name=foo.example.com format=pem_bundle').certificate }}
# Specify field inside lookup
{{ lookup('vault', 'secret/hello', 'value') }} # world
# This syntax for Ansible 1.9.x
{{ lookup('vault', ['secret/hello', 'value']) }} # world

# Dynamic secrets
{% set aws = lookup('vault', 'aws/creds/deploy') %}
access_key = {{ aws.access_key }} # AKSCAIZSFSYHFGA
secret_key = {{ aws.secret_key }} # 4XSLxDUS+hyXgoIHEhCKExHDGAJDHFiUA/adi
```

If the desired value is stored within Vault with the key 'value' (like
'value=world' shown above), within a task, the lookup can be performed with:

```yaml
with_vault:
- secret/hello
```

And then referenced with `"{{ item.value }}"`

Alternatively, the lookup can be performed with:

```yaml
with_vault:
- secret/hello
- value
```

And then referenced with `"{{ item }}"`

Both of these forms work with both Ansible 1.9.x and 2.x. They only work
within tasks, though. You can **not** use the `with_vault:` syntax within a
variable definition file.

### What's the difference between `ansible-vault` and `hashi_vault`

- (Ansible Vault) No external dependencies; (hashi_vault) requires hvac
- (Ansible Vault) Uses the same environment variables as vault itself
- (Ansible Vault) Quicker update cycle
- (Ansible Vault) Supports dynamic secrets
- (Ansible Vault) Supports custom fields
